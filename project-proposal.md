# **Project Description**

The purpose of this senior project is to secure people&#39;s private conversations on their chat applications. Nowadays there are a couple of companies that shared their user&#39;s information to 3rd party companies. This situation is illegal so we came up with a solution that was inspired by these kinds of problems that occurred at the beginning of 2021. The popular chat apps such as telegram, Turkcell&#39;s bip, etc. still haven&#39;t been able to solve the privacy problem that occurred, fully. Our goal is to make this privacy issue disappear and make people conversate without security doubts on their minds.

For users&#39; privacy and security, we came with the idea of using blockchain technology. It is a famous technology that uses in cryptocurrency. Most people just heard blockchain in this area but it is not limited to just that. This technology provides powerful security and reachability. With these features, we can able to develop the decentralized app. So this approach is very suitable for our purpose and needs. Thus, we will develop our chat application using blockchain technology.
